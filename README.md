# dotfiles

These dotfiles include configuration settings for various tools I use, such as [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/) for _Linux_ terminal customization, [Oh My Posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/) for _Windows_ terminal customization, EditorConfig, and many more.

Additionally, this repository contains template files that I use for other repositories, such as GitHub Actions Workflow, Dependabot, syncing labels, or the other commonly used dotfiles.
