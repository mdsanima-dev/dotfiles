# Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the entire project codebase to
# ensure readability and maintainability.  Consistent style not only improves
# collaboration but also makes the code easier to review and debug.
#
# Configuration for C/C++ code style formatting used by clang files, and the
# rules are applied to all code in the entire project.  This configuration is
# based on Google style guide, and customized for my own preferences.  These
# settings are mirrored in .editorconfig file.  Keep them in sync.  For more
# information about, refer to the official documentation at:
#
#       https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html
#
# The rules are still a work in progress and subject to change.  I still need
# to think about this configuration, and for now this is a base template.
