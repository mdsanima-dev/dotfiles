# mdsanima-shell

This is the documentation for the `mdsanima-shell` library, which is used to execute _Shell Scripts_ on **GNU/Linux** systems, like _Debian_ or _Ubuntu_.

The functions in this library are designed to manipulate the state of the computer and are commonly used in my `dotfiles` and other projects.
